My first tought is that i want to do the two challenges so i hope for the best.

Now that i have end after a week, i had learn so many things, for example float left is very importan but position relative is
the one that always let me position under the box that i want, i dont know if i explain very good but if you want to 
position box two under box one if the box one have a position relative is more easy to do this, other ways to do this is with
list(ul and ol).
It was very hard but i believe that i do my best try and i will keep going.

First challenge complet :)
